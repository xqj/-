											<p>Damon has spent the last 26 years working at some of the UK's best agencies for some of the UK's best agency owners.</p>

											<p>Richard was unaware that a degree in English literature and a stint running Italian nightclubs was preparing him for a career in advertising.</p>
											<p>A year at Ogilvy &amp; Mather having the smooth edges roughed up by brutally direct Ford car dealers helped him get a job at Bartle Bogle Hegarty in 1994. He joined the week Levi's Creek went on air, and his obsession with eye-popping ideas that transform businesses and brands was triggered.
											<p>Over the next 13 years he learnt his trade working on and leading several of the agency's domestic and international flagship accounts, including Audi, Polaroid, Sony Ericsson, Barclays, Gordons Gin and Warburtons.</p>
											<p>Always as driven by results as by the content itself, he authored the award-winning 1998 Audi IPA Effectiveness Paper.</p>
											<p>Blessed with good timing, his leadership roles at BBH London (Head of Account Management, New Business Director) occurred when the agency won three consecutive Campaign Magazine Agency of the Year titles.</p>
											<p>In 2004 Richard was appointed Global Business Development Director, working across Europe, Asia and The Americas helping land the likes of Vodafone, British Airways and Omo.</p>
											<p>In June 2007 Richard was appointed CEO of RKCR/Y&amp;R, then the UK's 7th biggest advertising agency (source: Nielsen.) Over the next five years, RKCR/Y&amp;R enjoyed unprecedented success: resisting the recession, diversifying into digital and design, and winning numerous effectiveness, Agency of The Year and creative awards on clients including Lloyds TSB, Virgin Atlantic, M&amp;S and BBC.</p>
											<p>When Richard resigned to start Joint with Damon, RKCR/Y&amp;R was top of the Gunn Report for UK creativity, top of Campaign Magazine's New Business League, and had grown to be the UK's 3rd biggest advertising agency (source: Nielsen).</p>
											<p>When he's not working, Richard runs some of the UK's slowest marathons and half-marathons, spends time trying to keep up with his lovely wife and two young daughters, and appears on TV, commenting on media, politics and business.</p>

										<div class="founder-blurb">
											<p>After five years as an English teacher, Lori found a new world in which she could analyse people's motivations and behavior, inspire creativity and help nurture talent.</p>
											<p>Starting out as a planner at Duckworth Finn Grubb Waters she worked on HEA Drugs Education, helping to create what was effectively a social media campaign before social media really existed, eventually co-authoring its IPA Effectiveness Grand Prix winning paper.</p>
											<p>Her greatest co-creations of all arrived soon after.</p>
											<p>Over the following years she balanced being a mum of two with, amongst other things helping develop Volkswagen's new service proposition, at The Foundation.</p>
											<p>Establishing HSBC as The World's Local Bank, at Lowe.</p>
											<p>Inspiring Red Bee to create a new channel identity.</p>
											<p>Encouraging people to gather round the nation's campfire, BBC One, with a new channel identity as well as getting them interacting with BBC TV by pressing the red button, whilst at Red Bee.</p>
											<p>Helping launch BBC's iPlayer.</p>
											<p>And positioning M&amp;S as "Quality Worth Every Penny" through recessionary times, winning awards including IPA, Marketing Society and Marketing Week Engage awards for effectiveness and becoming Joint Head of Planning, whilst at RKCR/Y&amp;R.</p>
											<p>A decade ago, Lori promised her family she'd go freelance once her girls were at secondary school. Honouring that promise, she then spent nearly a year working with an even more diverse group of people, for brands including dfs, New Look and HSBC (again).</p>
											<p>Until her daughters asked her why she was still 'driving with the brakes on' in her career. And told her they'd love her to help build something that really makes them proud...</p>
